# README

Ruby on Rails 

This is a basic blog application with 
  - a paginated index view
  - comments for each blog entry
  - user registration / administration
  - admin mode

The back-end is a PostgreSQL database. 
The front-end is pure SCSS and HTML5.

The main page has a self-written basic calendar.

In addition a small game variant of 
Rock-Paper-Scissors is implemented and can
be reached by selecting the RPS menu option. 

While RPS has a high probability of draws (1/3)
the implemented variant of Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock 
reduces it to (1/5). Simply choose the option you want
to play and the computer will automatically choose
randomly. The result is displayed immediately 
after you made your choice. Have fun.
